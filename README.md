# Hello, I am Chris!

Software engineer with four years of professional experience working with JavaScript and the MERN stack (Mongo/MySql, Express, React, Node js). My experience includes working with, teaching, providing code reviews, and one on one tutor sessions with JavaScript and the MERN stack. I am currently looking for a small to medium-sized development team to contribute and produce high-quality self-documented code in the long term. I am an extremely self-sufficient individual that is more than capable of rapidly teaching myself new technologies, with the capability to turn around and instruct others on what I just learned. I am two years into obtaining my bachelor of computer science, where I have completed my Python, Java, C++, and Data Science classes with A's. I am a respectful person, have a high work ethic, and enjoy working with others when needed.
